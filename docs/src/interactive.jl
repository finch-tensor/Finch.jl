using Finch

## Construct a CSR sparse input matrix (20% random nonzeros)
A = @fiber(d(sl(e(0.0))), fsprand((5, 7), 0.2))

## Construct a dense vector input and output (all random values)
x = rand(7)
y = rand(5)

## Emit code for matrix-vector multiply y = A * x
@finch_code begin
    for j = _, i = _
        y[i] += A[i, j] * x[j]
    end
end
